      I am a Ph.D. candidate at Vanderbilt University, studying
    astronomy. I received my A.S. in General Studies in Math and Natural Science
    from Washtenaw Community College, my B.S. in Astronomy & Astrophysics from
    the University of Michigan, and my M.A. in physics from Fisk University
    through the Fisk-Vanderbilt Master's-to-Ph.D.

      My research-related interests span a wide range, but include computer
    simulations, hydrodynamics, and general relativity. Fortunately for me I
    found the perfect project on which to work!
      <br><br>
      My non-research-related interests span an even wider range, but include
    cooking, being a dog dad to Daisy and Lily, enjoying the outdoors, and
    traveling. I am also a big advocate for animal welfare, especially stopping
    animal cruelty, as well as prison reform in the US.

      The stability of stars is due to the force of gravity being
    balanced by the pressure from the gas and radiation produced by
    nuclear fusion in the stellar core. When a star runs out of
    material to fuse this balance is lost, gravity takes over, and the
    star begins to collapse. Stars more massive than
    about eight suns end their lives with a tremendous
    explosion known as a supernova. The energy output of this
    explosion is approximately 100 times the energy that our
    sun will produce in its entire ten-million year lifetime! What's
    more, it is all released in a matter of seconds! These explosions
    distribute many of the heavy elements in the solar system,
    including carbon, the element on which life as we know it is
    based. So it behooves us to understand this process well, because
    it is to that which we literally owe our entire existence!
    Although there are many promising leads, it is not currently known
    exactly how the explosion proceeds.
      <br><br>
      What <i>is</i> known is that the core collapses until the
    pressure is so high that the
    repulsive electrical forces between the constituent atoms are
    overcome and the core transforms from a ball of iron
    into effectively one giant atomic nucleus--this is what will
    eventually become a neutron star (assuming it doesn't collapse to
    a black hole). This transition produces a shock wave that
    propagates outward. It is intuitive that this shock wave simply
    propagates through the entire star, blowing the material away with
    it. However, as often happens, nature is not so simple. It was
    discovered via computer simulations that the shock wave stalls
    about 200 km from the center of the star. The shock is
    <i>somehow</i> re-energized, and continues on its explosive
    path. The goal of the research group I'm in is to determine this
    re-energizing mechanism.
      <br><br>
      Currently I collaborate with Profs. Eirik Endeve and
    Anthony Mezzacappa at Oak Ridge National Laboratory on the <b>t</b>oolkit
    for <b>h</b>igh-<b>or</b>der <b>n</b>eutrino-r<b>ad</b>iation
    hydr<b>o</b>dynamics, <a
    style="font-family:'LucidaConsole',monospace">thornado</a>, a code
    that aims to numerically simulate core-collapse supernovae in
    three-dimensions. My work focuses on developing
    a module that solves the hydrodynamics equations to make them
    consistent with a 3+1 decomposition of general relativity under
    the conformally-flat approximation. To accomplish this we are
    using a discontinuous Galerkin method for spatial discretization
    and strong-stability-preserving Runge-Kutta methods for temporal
    discretization.

      One consequence of Einstein's theory of general relativity is
    that as light travels through a gravitational field, it is
    deflected. This phenomenon is known as <i>gravitational
    lensing</i>, because the effects are similar to those of light
    traveling through a lens. For these effects to be measurable,
    enormous masses are required, e.g. a star, a galaxy, or something
    even bigger! One source of measurable gravitational lensing is the
    light from entire galaxies being deflected by the mass of a galaxy
    cluster, the largest gravitationally-bound objects in the
    Universe. In analogy with a physical lens, gravitational lenses
    can also have magnifiaction effects, increasing the apparent size
    of a galaxy, allowing astronomers to see features that would
    otherwise be too small to see.
      <br><br>
      A special case of gravitational lensing is so-called <i>strong
    lensing</i>, where the light is deflected to such a degree that
    multiple light rays leaving the same point, but traveling in
    different directions, can all be bent directly toward us, causing
    us to see multiple images of the source (like the mouth and sides
    of the smiley face in the accompanying picture).
      <br><br>
      As an undergraduate I did research with Professor Keren Sharon
    in strong gravitational lensing, as part of the Sloan Giant Arcs
    Survey (SGAS). My work involved modeling these strong lenses
    (i.e. clusters of galaxies, two of which make up the eyes of the smiley
    face in the picture) to determine their masses based on the color,
    shape, and other properties of the multiple images.
